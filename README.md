# This repository contains data files pertaining to Sordillo, A. and Bargmann, C. I. (2021). 
# Data sets relevant to all of the main figures (excluding the optogenetics experiments) are included as both a .mat file that contains a MATLAB structure and a .csv file.
# Each genotype (or transgenic line) tested has its own files.  Files are named by experiment and then genotype/line.

# All reversal and forward run parameters (duration, speed, etc.) are derived as described in the Methods.
# All events per animal per minute are derived as described in the Methods. Data from all assays are pooled.
# All data provided are from 4-8 min off food during local search. 

# Analysis was completed using custom MATLAB functions.

# Nested MatLab structures were converted to .csv files using the following: Gero Nootz (2021). Nested Structure to table and or text file (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51271-nested-structure-to-table-and-or-text-file), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved January 17, 2020.
